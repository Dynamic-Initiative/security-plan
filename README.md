As you always would do when contributing, fork this repo and make changes but don't forget that:

We require [signed commits](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits) whenever possible, so when commiting changes, usage of GPG keys are required, if you don't know how to use git with GPG, then use Github web interface when making commits
